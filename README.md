## Hi, I'm Marisa, nice to meet you!

There are a few things you can know about me:

I'm a Programmer / tech person in Brazil improving my skills day by day.

My main study topics are: web development, data science, core computer science concepts and twinking with hardware. For now I'm using Python, Java. Google Colab and VS code for testing, building and studying. 

My goal in life is to learn how things work and build from that motivated by my curiosity and desire to make life a little bit easier for us.

I find books, running, games and learning very nice too.
