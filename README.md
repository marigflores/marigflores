## Hi, I'm Marisa, nice to meet you!

I'm a Programmer in Brazil always studying something, specially if computer, tech, dev or data related. 
I'm using Google Colab and VS code for testing, building and studying. 
I enjoy cccb: candy, cats, coffee and books, and to swim, walk, listen, laugh and, of course, build stuff.
