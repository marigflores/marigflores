## Yooo! I'm Marisa. A girl in my development arc. 

ðŸŒº There are a few things you should know about me:\n\n

  \tðŸŽ€i like doing tech experiments and playing with some cool tools i find online, so some repos maybe chaotic.\n
  \tðŸŽ€i'm a Software Development college student in Brazil trying my best.\n
  \tðŸŽ€i'm currently studying many topics such as app, web and game development, reviewing my knowledge on fixing old\n
  computers and learning through play about security concepts in secured environments. I'll be putting some of those\n
  studies here along with personal projects.\n
  \tðŸŽ€i love cats, books, running and musicals.\n\n

  \tðŸŽ€fun fact: Linux is amazing <3\n
  \tðŸŽ€relaxation-tip: stargazing.\n\n
