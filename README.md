## Hello, I'm Marisa, nice to meet you stranger :)

There are a few things you can know about me:

ðŸŽ€ I like playing with some cool tech i find online, so some repos maybe chaotic but always secured.

ðŸŽ€ I'm a Software Analysis and Development college student in Brazil doing my best to graduate.

ðŸŽ€ My main study topics are: web development, data science, core computer science concepts and twinking with hardware. I also play CTFs to learn security and how systems work. And have already tried game development with Godot Engine a few years ago.

ðŸŽ€ I find books, running, music, pixel art games and learning very nice.

ðŸŽ€I use, per now: Python, Java and Online environments.
